- title: Exploring How Convergence Methods Foster Shared Accountability to Reveal, Map, and Mitigate the Sources and Dynamics of Bias across Social Service Provisioning Systems
  status: To Begin
  fund: Funded

  description: An approach to designing social services, called "systems of care," organizes services around individuals and their specific context. The goal of this project is to (1) advance accountable software systems through developing generalizable and localizable practices for exploring how to identify systemic sources of bias, (2) improve public service provisioning outcomes, and (3) minimize disparities from biased program outcomes. The project will leverage social theories, computational methods, and ethnographic approaches to translate social science findings into software practices based on partnership with civic tech and non-profit organizations. The project outcome will enhance accountability in designing software systems that will be used as part of a larger socio-technical system of care.

- title: A Visualization Tool and Assessment Framework for Civic Technology Use in the DMV Area&colon; The Case of 311 Systems During the COVID-19 Outbreak
  status: Pending
  fund: Funded

  description: During a global pandemic, many jurisdictions have used civic technologies such as 311 systems to manage non-emergency issues such as the violation of mask mandates. While civic issues that residents need to communicate are similar across the regions, jurisdictions' imposed communication methods vary significantly due to their policies, legacy systems, and institutional logics. By working with our community partner, Connected DMV, this planning project aims to understand how local governments in the D.C. area implement communication technologies during a crisis, and how people reappropriate the systems. Ultimately, this project seeks to suggest a regional technology strategy to cope with regional issues such as pandemics.

- title: Risk Work and Risk Information Seeking during a Public Health Crisis
  status: On-Going
  image: "/assets/risk.jpg"
  description: This project explores the socio-material dynamics of risk work and risk information seeking during public health crises. We identify the socially-constructed dimensions of how people perceive risks, and further dive into how risk information communicated through social and technological systems shapes their risk behaviors, using ethnographic approaches.

- title: Making Information Deserts Visible&colon; Computational Models, Disparities in Civic Technology Use, and Urban Decision Making
  status: On-Going
  fund: Funded
  image: "/assets/311_block.png"
  description: This research develops a foundational visualization tool for understanding how civic technologies are used and how information inequalities manifest in a city. By leveraging Boston's 311 data (i.e., residents' reports of non-emergency civic issues such as traffic issues), we explore how and why public services are unevenly distributed across neighborhoods, which leads to the creation of information deserts. Then, we design a visualization system that demonstrates the relationships between socio-economic factors and the information deserts of civic issues.

  status: On-Going
  fund: Funded
  image: "/assets/meetup.png"
  description: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly playing more active roles than ever on Event-based Social Network (EBSN) platforms and is expected to alter local dynamics at scale. This pilot project aims to uncover how human-AI collaboration happens at the community level by implementing and simulating machine learning algorithms at the ecological level using local gathering data from Meetup.com.

- title: Remapping Southside Community&colon; Storytelling Urban Renewal Impact
  status: On-Going
  image: "/assets/remapping.png"
  description: This project builds a map-based archival platform that presents property acquisition documents of the City of Asheville, North Carolina, from the urban renewal in the 1960s and '70s. The platform focuses on the searchability and navigability of the digitized archival collection, so former residents, archivists, researchers, and citizens can access necessary information better. This platform ultimately reconstructs a virtual neighborhood where people can share their memories and tell stories. This project leverages computational methods for curating historical data, GIS technologies for dynamic visualization, and value-sensitive design for designing the system.
